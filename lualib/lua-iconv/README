=== INTRODUCTION ===

Lua-iconv is POSIX 'iconv' binding for the Lua Programming Language. The
iconv library converts a sequence of characters from one codeset into a
sequence of corresponding characters in another codeset. The codesets
are those specified in the iconv.new() call that returned the conversion
descriptor, cd.

Lua-iconv r5 *requires* Lua 5.1. If you are using Lua 5.0, please use the
first release (lua-iconv-r1).

=== DOWNLOAD, COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION ===

Lua-iconv can be obtained from its LuaForge project page:
http://lua-iconv.luaforge.net/

Lua-iconv must be compiled as a shared object and loaded by the Lua
interpreter using the new module system in Lua 5.1. 

If you are using a system with pkg-config (as many Linux distributions and
Unix flavors) just fire up your favourite shell, untar the distribution
package and type, as root, within the program directory:

    make install

The library will be compiled and installed on the in the correct path (that
is defined in lua5.1.pc.

Compiling on systems without pkg-config requires manual changes on the
Makefile.



=== LOADING AND INITIALIZATION ===

Lua-iconv is a shared library that exports a single function called
luaopen_iconv that must be called by the Lua interpreter. Lua 5.1
uses the new package system, so you can simply do a

    require "iconv"

call to load up the library (that, of course, must be installed in a
directory from package.cpath).



=== USAGE ===

cd = iconv.new(to, from)
cd = iconv.open(to, from)

    Opens a new conversion descriptor, from the 'from' charset to the
    'to' charset. Concatenating "//TRANSLIT" to the first argument will
    enable character transliteration and concatenating "//IGNORE" to
    the first argument will cause iconv to ignore any invalid characters
    found in the input string.

    This function returns a new converter or nil on error.


nstr, err = cd:iconv(str)

    Converts the 'str' string to the desired charset. This method always
    returns two arguments: the converted string and an error code, which
    may have any of the following values:

    nil
        No error. Conversion was succeful.

    iconv.ERROR_NO_MEMORY
        Failed to allocate enough memory in the conversion process.

    iconv.ERROR_INVALID
        An invalid character was found in the input sequence.

    iconv.ERROR_INCOMPLETE
        An incomplete character was found in the input sequence.
        
    iconv.ERROR_UNKNOWN
        There was an unknown error.
